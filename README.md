##General Description

This repo contains my solutions to the first 11 questions of 
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/problems).

The solutions are written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) 
according to [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) 
(testing with [Rspec](http://rspec.info/)).


##Testing

Tests were written with [Rspec](http://rspec.info/) (3.1.0).

To run the tests in terminal, clone the repo locally and run: 

```bash
$> cd project_euler
$> rspec
```
